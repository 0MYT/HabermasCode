    <h1>Habermas and the Public Sphere</h1>

See the instructions/guidelines that start just before the table...

        <p class="start">Habermas says that </p>
        <blockquote id="from-habermas">At one time, the process of making things public [<i>Publizit&auml;t</i>] was intended to subject persons or affairs to public reason, and to make political decisions subject to appeal before the court of public opinion. But often enough today the process of making public simply serves the arcane policies of special intersts; in the form of "publicity" it wins public prestige for people or affairs, thus making them worth of acclamation in a climate of non-public opnion. <img id="struktur" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ic4%2Bjf-RL._SX304_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" />

        <p>If you believe this narrative -- in which the public sphere has suffered a marked decline since the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century &mdash; the open question is, can the Web reverse that trend? Everything depends on what you think the main virtues of the public sphere are, and how the Web can prop them up.</p>

        <h2> The Web Strikes Back </h2>
        <img class="head-shot" alt="Tim Berners-Lee" title="he sure was young!" src="http://worldwebforum.ch/download/attachments/12703568/03_13.jpg?version=1&modificationDate=1463641226643&api=v2" />
        <p class="start"> When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> first tried to build a web browser, he thought it would be a kind of specialized word processor. he imagined that every user would be <i>creating</i> as much as <i>consuming</i>. He wanted to call it the "read/write web". But browsers never became the creation tools he wanted them to be. Instead we now have <a href="http://facebook.com">websites</a> that invite creation. These present their own encodings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden_%28technology%29">public</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/privacy">private</a>.
        </p>
        <p id="bad-news">The truth is, today, Jan 20, 2017, the web has given us a gift: the first pathological narcissist to hold the presidency in some time. How much responsiblility do Twitter and Breitbart hold? WHat if, instead of a Public Sphere, we've just ended up with an infinite array of vacuous each ochambers? What happens to legitimacy, authenticity, democracy, then?
        </p>
        <p class="main"> Think about the structure of HTML (links, hypertext) and also about the interactivity that the Web now gives you. Make an argument IN HTML about whether the Web saves the Public Sphere (<a href="http://www.humanities.uci.edu/mposter/writings/democ.html">Mark Poster thinks it does</a>) or continues to pose problems for it. As you do this, <strong>use as many tags as you can, and mess with the CSS on this page if you have a chance</strong>. </p>
