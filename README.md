# HabermasCode

This is an exercise to get you used to editing HTML and a tiny bit of CSS (tiny!). It's a toy repo that you can experiment with as you want. It may be a btter place to start than your assignment 01 repo. 

## Installation
Fork this repository on Github, then clone in VSCode. Open in VSCode and edit the files. You know the drill by now. 

## Using the repo
This is just a place for you to try to work a little bit with html while also getting used to VSCode.  

- remember the tags we learned about in lecture; use them here.
- perhaps create a new branch and exlore git somewhat
- explore the CSS if you're interested
- look for easster eggs :-) 
- use the live preview functions to view your changes as you work

`index.html` is the main file, and you can make most of your changes there. `style.css`will also be fun!
