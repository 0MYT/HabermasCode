# HabermasCode

The same exercise we did last week, but this time in CSS. You can also try this [on JSBin](http://jsbin.com/yawujap/1/edit?html,css,js,output)

(NOTE: this is not really the right way to make two versions of a repo! Instead, we should just have two forks -- one HTML, one CSS -- and periodically [rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) each other's changes. But I was afraid that might be hard to do in class... so here we are instead.

## Installation
Fork this repository on Github, then clone at the command line with 
```sh
git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/HabermasCode.git
```
or do it directly through the Github desktop app. 

## Usage
Open in Atom and edit the files. You will need an HTML previewer such as `atom-html-preview` or `preview-plus`, as well as a markdown previewr such as `markdown-preview`. Install them through the package managers (`Preferences` -> `Install`). 

`index.html` is the main file, and you can make most of your hanges there.

You can also experiment with `index.md`, which demonstrates both the __simplicity__ of Markdown, and its __limitations__. The javascript and style information is not included here since Github-Flavoured Markdown (GFM) strips those tags when rendering.
