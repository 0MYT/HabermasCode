# HabermasCode

This is an exercise to get you used to editing HTML and a tiny bit of CSS (tiny!). It's a toy repo that you can experiment with as you want. It may be a btter place to start than your assignment 01 repo. 

## Installation
Fork this repository on Github, then clone in VSCode. Open in VSCode and edit the files. You know the drill by now. 

`index.html` is the main file, and you can make most of your changes there. `style.css`will also be fun!

ignore `index.md` this year!
